## 🤔 Should You Self-Host?

### ✅ Only Do This If:

- **💰 Private repos costing real money** - You're exceeding free tier and paying $0.008/minute
- **💵 Money matters more than everything else** - You're willing to accept worse performance, reliability, and
  convenience to save costs

### ❌ Don't Do This If:

- **📂 Public repositories** - You already have **unlimited free minutes** on GitHub-hosted runners (which are also faster)
- **⚡ Speed matters** - GitHub-hosted runners are faster
- **🏃 Parallelism matters** - GitHub can run multiple jobs simultaneously; self-hosted = one at a time
- **🔧 Convenience matters** - No maintenance, no monitoring, no troubleshooting with GitHub-hosted
- **📊 Reliability matters** - GitHub's infrastructure is more reliable than consumer NAS
- **💤 Within free tier** - If you're under 2,000-3,000 minutes/month, GitHub-hosted is free AND better

### ⚖️ Honest Trade-Offs

**What you gain:**

- 💰 **Zero per-minute costs** for private repos (save $64/month if using 10,000 minutes)

**What you sacrifice:**

- 🔧 **Maintenance burden** - Updates, monitoring, troubleshooting, disk space management now your responsibility
- ⏰ **Setup time** - 30-60 minutes initial setup plus ongoing maintenance
- 🤯 **Complexity** - Docker, networking, security configuration vs "just works" on GitHub

**Hardware-dependent factors:**

- 📊 **Performance** - Speed depends entirely on your Synology hardware (CPU, RAM, storage type)
- 🚦 **Parallelism** - This guide covers a single runner setup. You could run multiple runners if you have
  sufficient CPU/RAM, but most consumer NAS devices aren't specced for that
- 💾 **Resource constraints** - Lower-end devices (2-4 cores, 8GB RAM) typically run one runner; high-end
  devices could support multiple

**Your mileage WILL vary.** The only universal benefit is cost savings for private repositories.

### 💰 Cost Savings Calculator (Private Repos Only)

**Is it worth the trade-offs for your hobby project?**

| Monthly Minutes | GitHub Cost | Self-Hosted Cost | Annual Savings | Worth It? |
| --------------- | ----------- | ---------------- | -------------- | --------- |
| 3,000 (free tier) | $0 | $0 | **$0** | ❌ No cost savings |
| 10,000 | $64/mo | $0 | **$768/year** | 🎨 Maybe for hobby projects |
| 25,000 | $184/mo | $0 | **$2,208/year** | 🎨 Good for large hobby projects |
| 50,000 | $392/mo | $0 | **$4,704/year** | 🏢 At this scale, consider managed solutions |

> **Bottom line:** This is for hobby projects and learning, not businesses. If you're a business spending
> $200+/month on Actions, just pay for it—your team's time is worth more than the savings. This is for
> hobbyists who enjoy tinkering and want to avoid costs on personal projects.

## 🎨 Example Workflows

### Basic CI Workflow

```yaml
name: CI
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: [self-hosted, Linux, X64]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Run tests
        run: ./gradlew test
```

### Orchestrator Pattern (Resource-Constrained)

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline
on: [push, pull_request]

concurrency:
  group: synology-runner
  cancel-in-progress: false  # Queue instead of cancel

jobs:
  test-shared:
    uses: ./.github/workflows/test-shared.yml

  test-app:
    needs: test-shared
    uses: ./.github/workflows/test-app.yml

  deploy:
    needs: [test-shared, test-app]
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    uses: ./.github/workflows/deploy.yml
```

See [examples/workflows/](examples/workflows/) for more patterns.

## 💰 Primary Benefit: Eliminate Per-Minute Costs

**For private repositories that exceed the free tier (2,000-3,000 minutes/month), this eliminates per-minute costs.**

### ⚖️ The Trade-Offs

Compared to GitHub-hosted runners, self-hosting on Synology means:

| Dimension | GitHub-Hosted | Self-Hosted (Synology) |
| --------- | ------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Speed** | Fast (cloud infrastructure) | **Hardware-dependent** - Varies by device |
| **Parallelism** | Multiple jobs simultaneously | **Hardware-dependent** - Single runner typical; multiple possible with sufficient resources |
| **Reliability** | Enterprise SLA, managed infrastructure | Your hardware and maintenance |
| **Maintenance** | ✅ Zero (managed by GitHub) | ❌ Your responsibility |
| **Setup** | ✅ Just works | ❌ 30-60 min setup + ongoing |
| **Cost (private)** | ❌ $0.008/min after free tier | ✅ $0 per-minute |
| **Cost (public)** | ✅ Free unlimited | ✅ Free unlimited |

### 🎯 Who This Is For

**✅ Good fit:**

- 🎨 **Hobby projects** with heavy CI usage (personal projects, side projects, open-source work)
- 🎓 **Learning** about self-hosted CI/CD infrastructure
- 💰 **Hobbyists** with private repos exceeding free tier who want to tinker and save money
- 🔬 **Experimentation** with CI/CD setups and optimization

**❌ NOT for:**

- 🏢 **Businesses or organizations** - Just pay for GitHub Actions or use enterprise CI/CD
- 💼 **Production-critical infrastructure** - Needs reliability, SLAs, and professional support
- 👔 **Professional development teams** - Your time is worth more than the cost savings
- ⚖️ **Mission-critical workflows** - Use managed infrastructure with proper support

### 🎯 When This Makes Sense Technically

Self-host if:

1. ✅ **Private repositories** exceeding free tier (actually costing you money)
2. ✅ **Hobby/learning context** (not business-critical)
3. ✅ **Comfortable managing infrastructure** (Docker, networking, monitoring)
4. ✅ **Enjoy tinkering** with self-hosted solutions

Don't self-host if:

1. ❌ **Public repositories** (already free on GitHub)
2. ❌ **Within free tier** (under 2,000-3,000 min/month = no cost savings)
3. ❌ **Business/organization use** (just pay for proper infrastructure)
4. ❌ **Want zero maintenance** (GitHub-hosted "just works")

**Performance depends entirely on your Synology hardware.** This is about hobby cost optimization and learning,
not enterprise infrastructure.

## 🔧 Customization

### Resource Limits

Adjust in `.env`:

```bash
# For 2-core/8GB system (conservative)
RUNNER_CPUS=1.5
RUNNER_MEMORY=5G
GRADLE_OPTS=-Xmx3g

# For 4-core/16GB system (recommended)
RUNNER_CPUS=3
RUNNER_MEMORY=10G
GRADLE_OPTS=-Xmx6g
```

### Labels

Add custom labels to target specific runners:

```bash
LABELS=self-hosted,Linux,X64,synology,kotlin,docker
```

Then use in workflows:

```yaml
runs-on: [self-hosted, kotlin]
```

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

✅ **Use minimal GitHub PAT scopes** - Only `repo` and `workflow`
✅ **Enable read-only filesystem** - Included in docker-compose.yml
✅ **Drop all capabilities** - Only add what's needed
✅ **Use tmpfs for sensitive data** - Ephemeral storage for tokens
✅ **Regular updates** - Keep runner image up to date
✅ **Monitor logs** - Watch for suspicious activity

See [Security Guide](docs/07-SECURITY.md) for complete hardening checklist.

## 📈 Monitoring Dashboard

Run the included dashboard script:

```bash
/volume1/scripts/runner-dashboard.sh
```
