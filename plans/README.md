### [plan-6-multi-repo-runner.md](plan-6-multi-repo-runner.md)

**🔴 Not Started**

Investigate and document how to configure a single runner to serve multiple repositories under a personal GitHub account.

**Goals:**

- Research how GitHub runners work with multiple repos
- Test both personal account and organization-level approaches
- Document simplest working solution with step-by-step instructions
- Provide migration guide from single-repo to multi-repo setup

**Key Questions:**

- Can repository-level runner serve multiple repos in personal account?
- Should users create a GitHub Organization?
- What are pros/cons of each approach?
- How do concurrent jobs from different repos interact?

**Deliverables:**

- `docs/09-MULTI-REPO-SETUP.md` - Complete multi-repo guide
- Updated configuration documentation
- Tested migration path
- Clear recommendation: personal vs organization approach

**Priority:** Medium
**Duration:** 2-3 hours

### [plan-5-restart-reliability.md](plan-5-restart-reliability.md)

**🔴 Not Started - Critical Issue**

Fix runner crash-loop after Synology NAS restarts. Currently requires manual intervention (delete container + rebuild).

**Priority:** High (blocks production use)
**Duration:** 2-3 hours

**Problem:**

- Runner enters crash-loop after NAS reboot
- Container repeatedly restarts but doesn't recover
- Requires manual deletion and rebuild of container

**Proposed Solutions:**

- Enhanced health checks with longer start period
- Initialization script with pre-checks
- Improved restart policy with delays
- Startup delay to wait for volumes/network

## Plan Status Legend

- 🔴 **Not Started** - Plan created, work not begun
- 🟡 **In Progress** - Currently being worked on
- 🟢 **Complete** - All tasks finished and verified
- ⏸️ **Blocked** - Waiting on dependencies
- 🔄 **In Review** - Under testing or review

## Using These Plans

The implementation plans serve multiple purposes:

1. **Work Planning** - Clear tasks and acceptance criteria
2. **Progress Tracking** - Update status as work progresses
3. **Knowledge Preservation** - Document decisions and context
4. **Future Reference** - Guide for similar projects

### How to Work With Plans

1. **Read the full plan** before starting work
2. **Update status** as you progress (🔴 → 🟡 → 🟢)
3. **Document decisions** in notes sections
4. **Mark tasks complete** with checkboxes
5. **Add observations** about what worked/didn't work

### Keeping Plans Updated

⚠️ **CRITICAL:** Always keep plans up to date as you work. See
[CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) for detailed guidance on updating plans.

**When to Update:**

- Starting a plan (🔴 → 🟡)
- Completing tasks (check boxes)
- Finishing a plan (🟡 → 🟢)
- Discovering issues or blockers
- Making architectural decisions

## Roadmap to v1.0.0

To reach version 1.0.0, complete these plans in order:

1. ✅ **Foundation** - Repository created, scripts written, core docs done
2. 🟢 **Plan 1** - Repository integration (MOSTLY COMPLETE - just create .env)
3. 🟡 **Plan 2** - Monitoring setup (READY TO START)
4. 🔴 **Plan 5** - Fix restart reliability (CRITICAL - blocks production use)
5. 🔴 **Plan 3** - CI/CD workflows (recommended before v1.0.0)
6. 🟡 **Plan 4** - Documentation & examples (in progress, ~60% complete)
7. 🔄 **Final Review** - Test everything, polish, prepare release

**Priority order:**

- **Must complete:** Plans 1, 2, 5 (core functionality + reliability)
- **Strongly recommended:** Plan 3 (quality gates for contributions)
- **Nice to have:** Plan 4 completion (comprehensive docs and examples)

**Critical Path:**

- Plan 1 (mostly done) → Plan 2 → Plan 5 (core infrastructure + monitoring + reliability)
- Plan 3 can start anytime (needs working runner for CI/CD)
- Plan 4 is ongoing (documentation work)

**Note:** Plan 5 is CRITICAL - the runner must survive reboots for production use.

## From Planechaser Project

This infrastructure was originally built to support the Planechaser project (a
Kotlin Multiplatform app) and has been extracted into its own repository for
reusability and community benefit.

The architecture and patterns developed here are applicable to any GitHub
repository needing self-hosted runners on resource-constrained hardware.

## Contributing to Plans

If you're working on implementing these plans:

1. Update plan files as you work (don't let them go stale)
2. Document any deviations from the original plan
3. Add lessons learned in notes sections
4. Update this README if plan structure changes

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) (when created) for full contribution guidelines.
